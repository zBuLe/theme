Here is a refined and detailed synopsis of the Corlee, written strictly from an in-universe perspective for the World of Threa. All real-world inspirations and meta-commentary have been separated into a dedicated section at the end.

## The Corlee of Threa

The Corlee are a stateless, matriarchal people who exert incredible influence across the World of Threa. Rather than claiming geographic borders or conquering with standing armies, their power is strictly logistical. They live within the existing cities and kingdoms of other races, operating a massive, borderless shadow state. They govern through supply chains, economic dependency, debt, and localized coercion, making themselves indispensable to the regions they inhabit.

### Biology and Appearance

The Corlee are imposing, primal humanoids with prominent canine traits. They are covered in fur with a wide variety of coat patterns, boast long floppy ears, and tend to grow voluminous hair. They have distinct four-fingered hands and four-toed feet, which heavily influences their tool design and grip.

* **Dimorphism:** Both sexes are highly muscular. Males typically reach around 6 feet in height, while females are naturally larger, growing up to 7.5 feet tall.
* **Chromatic Lineage:** Corlee genetics feature a highly structured and culturally significant color inheritance system for eyes and hair. Colors are divided into two opposing triads: one consisting of Red, Green, and Blue, and the other consisting of Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow.
* **Inheritance Rules:** Children are born with colors their parents do *not* possess. If parents share a triad category, the child inherits the remaining colors. If parents are of mixed categories, the outcomes expand predictably. Rare genetic expressions can result in stark white or pitch-black hair, which broadly expands the possible traits of their future offspring. Because these lineages are so highly visible, they are often used for identity verification or exploited for fraud.

### Culture and Gender Roles

Corlee society is strictly matriarchal, completely inverting the domestic expectations of many other cultures in Threa.

* **Household Dynamics:** Women are the heads of the household, the breadwinners, and the absolute authority figures, taking on a role of discipline and provision. Men manage the home, handle the day-to-day rearing of children, and provide domestic stability and care.
* **Attire as Civic Language:** Clothing is functional but highly communicative. Commoners wear varied colors, with men favoring straight-line patterns and women favoring curved lines. Wealthier Corlee dress predominantly in stark black and white.
* **Garments:** Standard wear includes sleeveless shirts, long shorts, heavy boots, legwarmers, and arm-length fingerless gloves. Women often wear elaborate ponchos, shawls, and headbands. Men wear short or long sleeves, as bare shoulders on men are considered provocative.
* **Ornamentation:** Hardware signals intent. Men use rivets and tags to denote bureaucratic authorization or route-coding. Women use spikes to project status, intimidation, and ceremonial aggression.

### Society: Commoners vs. The Families

The Corlee population is divided into two distinct halves:

* **The Commoners (The Majority):** Everyday laborers, miners, smiths, and merchants. They abide by the laws of their host nations and often resent the criminal reputation brought upon their people. However, they directly benefit from the cheap goods, stable supplies, and suppressed street crime that Corlee territories provide.
* **The Families (The Minority):** The criminal-aristocracy that holds the true power. Led by powerful matriarchs, these syndicates capture local institutions by controlling essential supplies, utilizing bribery, extortion, counterfeiting, and intimidation to bend local governments to their will.

### The Shadow Economy: Marketplaces and Shops

The Families govern through nested logistical networks that ignore national borders. The largest of these are **Marketplaces** (like the Medci or Borga Marketplaces), which oversee vast economic zones. These are subdivided into **Shops** (like Rotsi, Forents, and Lirudce), which act as localized nodes of control.

Trade flows through a strict, three-part pipeline designed for plausible deniability:

1. **The Dock (Intake):** The enforcement-heavy entry point where extorted tribute, stolen goods, or coerced taxes enter the network.
2. **The Backroom (Laundering):** The hidden middle step, often disguised as halfway-houses or inns, where goods are consolidated, repacked, and stripped of traceable origins.
3. **The Stands (Retail):** The public face where "clean" goods are sold at highly competitive prices, cementing the local populace's dependency.

### Hierarchy of the Syndicate

The Families operate on a strict chain of command, utilizing non-Family assets to keep their hands clean.

* **Donna:** The ultimate matriarch heading a major Family and Marketplace.
* **Matrina:** Strategic advisors and auditors answering to the Donna.
* **Sicar:** Elite assassins loyal only to Donnas, who pass their trade down to their firstborn daughters.
* **Dulcine:** A regional boss managing a Shop under a larger Family's umbrella.
* **Donnelle:** The head of a smaller, independent single-Shop family.
* **Capri:** Captains who lead the muscle and manage local Docks.
* **Goon:** Foot soldiers and enforcers.
* **Cover (Non-Family):** Civilians (often Corlee commoners) coerced or paid to transport goods and provide legitimate fronts for Backrooms.
* **Fixer (Non-Family):** Disposable operatives (often non-Corlee) hired for the dirtiest work to maintain the Family's deniability.

### Combat and Arsenal

Corlee reject traditional forged armor, relying on their natural hardiness and debilitating blunt-force trauma to ensure enemies cannot hit back. Elites, such as Donnas, wear a jet-black **Prestigious Shawl** that offers slight defensive buffs and projects absolute authority. Their weapons of choice are specialized **Clubs**, ranging from easily concealed billysticks designed to stun, to massive two-handed "Breaker Clubs" that cause extreme knockback and paralysis.

## Meta Notes & Real-World Inspirations

* **Visual Aesthetics:** The functional yet theatrical clothing style of the Corlee is heavily inspired by real-world punk, metal, and glam rock fashion.
* **Biological Inspirations:** The varied fur patterns of the Corlee are directly modeled after real-world dog breeds, such as the solid coats of Labradors and Golden Retrievers, or the spotted coats of Dalmatians.
* **Color Theory:** The chromatic lineage system is based on the primary color models used in digital screens and physical printing: RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and CMY (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow).
* **Naming Conventions:** Corlee names and Family titles are inspired by Italian history and mobster cinema. The race's name "Corlee" is a nod to the Corleone family from *The Godfather*, and the "Medci" Marketplace is inspired by the historical House of Medici.

Would you like me to organize a breakdown of the specific club variants and their combat stats next, or should we expand on one of the local case studies like Greendirt Town?
